# Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic for Kung Fu
This project demonstrates how to use the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm to solve the Kung Fu Master game, a classic arcade game that provides a challenging environment for reinforcement learning. The code is implemented in Python using the Gymnasium library for the environment and PyTorch for building the neural network.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the A3C algorithm.
- Training and evaluation of the model in the Kung Fu Master environment.
- Visualization of the results and the agent's performance.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the required packages. You can do this directly in your Jupyter Notebook or Colab environment.
```bash
!pip install gymnasium torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Gymnasium
- PyTorch
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
